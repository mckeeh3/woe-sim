# Installation and Setup of Cassandra

Follow these instructions for setting up a database for the `woe-sim` microservice.

## Akka Persistence Cassandra

There are a number of available database services to choose from. Akka Persistence provides multiple
[Persistence Plugins](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-plugins.html).

This section provides instructions for setting up Cassandra. Please see the the
[Akka Persistence Cassandra](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/current/)
documentation for additional details.
### Local Cassandra for Minikube

With Minikube you can use a local Cassandra installation. First,
[download Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/download/). Follow the
[Installation Instructions](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html).

**Important:** change the `listen_address` setting in the `<install-dir>/conf/conf/cassandra.yaml` configuration file to an IP address that is accessible from within Minikube. This is usually the IP of your local system. Processes running within Minikube cannot access the default localhost that Cassandra is configured to use.

**Important:** change the seed configuration setting. Open the configuration file as described above. Find the `seed_provider` property, then look for `seeds`. Change from localhost to the IP used above.

**Important:** comment out the `rpc_address` line. Open the configuration file as described above. Find the `rpc_address` property, and comment out this line.

~~~bash
#rpc_address: localhost
~~~

#### Run Cassandra Locally

**NOTE** Cassandra requires Java 8. The following instructions assume that you are using a later version of Java.

If necessary, deploy Java 8.

Open a terminal window and run the following commands.

~~~bash
export JAVA_HOME=<path-to-your-java-8-deployment>
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
cd <path-to-cassandra>
./bin/cassandra -f
~~~

#### Create Tables

Use the following steps to create the required tables.

~~~bash
cd <woe-sim-directory>/src/main/resources
~~~

Run the `cqlsh` utility.

~~~bash
<path-to-cassandra-directory>/bin/cqlsh localhost 9042
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.11.8 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
~~~

Execute the following CQL script to create the tables.

~~~bash
cqlsh> source 'akka-persistence-journal-create-sim.cql'
~~~

Verify that the tables were created.

~~~bash
cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system_schema  system         system_distributed
system_auth    woe_simulator  system_traces

cqlsh> use woe_simulator;
cqlsh:woe_simulator> describe tables;

tag_views  tag_scanning         tag_write_progress
messages   all_persistence_ids  metadata

cqlsh:woe_simulator> quit
~~~
